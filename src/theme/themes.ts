/**
 * Theme registry (session 16 — the Pro dialog's appearance settings).
 *
 * The app's theming is a TWO-layer attribute system on the document
 * root:
 *
 *   data-theme="<id>"    the concrete palette (token block in
 *                        tokens.css) — what the user picks.
 *   data-scheme="light|dark"  the FAMILY the palette belongs to.
 *                        Everything that only cares about
 *                        light-vs-dark reads this instead of guessing
 *                        from the theme id: the canvas viz's cell
 *                        saturation boost, the tone-family CSS (pastel
 *                        vs vivid), and the 25 dark-family CSS rules
 *                        (folder cards, quick-win icons, rank bars…).
 *
 * `light` and `dark` remain the canonical pair (the topbar's quick
 * toggle flips between exactly those two — a custom theme never
 * becomes the toggle's target; the picker owns the custom themes).
 *
 * Palette directions (researched against premium precedent — warm
 * espresso + honey for Ember, deep marine + lagoon cyan for Tide,
 * blush cream + rose for Blossom; none touch the generic
 * violet/purple AI-gradient territory, per the owner's direction):
 *   light    neutral white + coral (the shipped default)
 *   dark     neutral graphite + coral
 *   ember    warm espresso surfaces + honey-gold ink
 *   tide     deep marine surfaces + lagoon-cyan ink
 *   blossom  blush cream surfaces + rose ink
