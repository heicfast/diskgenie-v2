═══════════ AGEMAP GAPS ═══════════
Here is a comprehensive, production-grade audit of the visual gaps between the **Target (Image 1)** and **Current (Image 2)** implementations:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Top Navigation Bar (Global):** 
    *   Image 2 is missing the `<` back-navigation arrow before the drive name ("This PC").
    *   The "Filter by name" search bar in Image 2 includes a "Ctrl+K" shortcut badge and a "Cleanup" button that are absent in the target design.
    *   Image 2 adds a "Free" status pill in the top-right corner.
*   **Main Header Area:**
    *   **Toolbar:** Image 2 uses a different icon set for the view toggles (e.g., flame icon vs. clock icon) and lacks the prominent red "Age Map" toggle button present in Image 1. It also replaces the "A" sort button with a list/sort toggle.
    *   **Warning Banner:** Image 1 has a two-line warning with an "Open Privacy Settings" action button. Image 2 simplifies this to a single line with only a close (`x`) button.
*   **Right Sidebar (Details Panel):**
    *   **Header:** Image 1 shows "Library" with a folder sub-label. Image 2 shows "This PC" with a large folder icon and a `C:\` path input field below it.
    *   **Action Buttons:** Image 1 ends with "Reveal", "Quick Look", "Focus", and "Copy Path". Image 2 replaces these with "Reveal", "Preview", "Focus", "Copy Path", and a large, full-width orange **"Add to Cleanup"** button at the bottom.

### 2. Color & Styling Differences
*   **Primary Action Button:**
    *   Image 1 ("Scan Full Mac"): Bright, saturated orange-red (`#FF5F57` or similar).
    *   Image 2 ("Scan This PC"): Muted, darker coral-orange (`#F26D4B` or similar).
*   **Chart Colors (Age Map):**
    *   **Green (Last 7 days):** Target is a vibrant mint green (`#2ED573`). Current is a darker, more standard green (`#27AE60`).
    *   **Blue (8-30 days):** Target is a soft sky blue (`#70A1FF`). Current is a deeper royal blue (`#3498DB`).
    *   **Purple (3-12 months):** Target is a light lavender (`#A29BFE`). Current is a heavy indigo/purple (`#9B59B6`).
    *   **Pink (1-2 years):** Target is a soft pastel pink (`#FD79A8`). Current is a hot, saturated pink (`#E91E63`).
    *   **Red/Orange (Over 2 years):** Target is a light salmon/coral (`#FAB1A0`). Current is a stark red (`#E74C3C`).
*   **Text Colors:**
    *   **"Used" storage value:** Target is Red (`#FF4757`). Current is a darker, brownish-red (`#C0392B`).
    *   **"Free" storage value:** Target is bright Green (`#2ED573`). Current is a darker forest green (`#27AE60`).
*   **Backgrounds:**
    *   The calendar heatmap in Image 1 has visible blue data cells. In Image 2, it is almost entirely empty/greyed out except for one cell with a distinct orange/red border highlight not seen in the target.

### 3. Typography & Content
*   **Header Stats:** 
    *   Image 1 displays 3 metrics: Size, File count, Folder count.
    *   Image 2 displays the same 3 but with different values and formatting (e.g., `129 GB • 1,546 files • 55 folders`).
*   **Sidebar Details:**
    *   **Label Mismatch:** Image 1 has "Compressed by". Image 2 has "Compressed / sparse savings".
    *   **Values:** Almost every numerical value in the right-hand details panel differs between the two images (e.g., Logical size is `8.47 GB` in target vs `167 GB` in current).

### 4. Component & Visualization Rendering
*   **Donut Chart (Disk Storage):**
    *   **Target (Img 1):** Thick stroke, solid colors, clean 90.1% text centered.
    *   **Current (Img 2):** Thinner stroke, slightly different proportions (88%), and the inner text styling feels lighter/thinner.
*   **Horizontal Bar Chart (Ages):**
    *   **Target (Img 1):** Bars have rounded caps (pill shape) on both ends.
    *   **Current (Img 2):** Bars appear to have flat ends or much tighter rounding. The background track is also a lighter grey.
*   **Calendar Heatmap:**
    *   **Target (Img 1):** Shows a populated year (2026) with multiple blue-shaded cells indicating data density.
    *   **Current (Img 2):** Shows mostly empty cells for 2023-2026. One cell in late 2026 has a prominent **orange outline/border**, which acts as a selection state not present in the target's static view.
*   **Quick Wins List:**
    *   **Icons:** The icons used for categories (e.g., Caches, Large media) differ in style (filled vs. outlined, different shapes).
    *   **Items:** The list content is entirely different (Image 1 lists `node_modules`, `Xcode DerivedData`; Image 2 lists `VM disks`, `Developer caches`).
*   **Bottom Section:**
    *   Image 1 ends after the calendar.
    *   Image 2 introduces a new **"Big & Untouched"** file list section and a **"FILE TYPES"** breakdown list in the left sidebar, which are completely missing from the target design.

### 5. Alignment & Spacing
*   **Sidebar Width:** The left sidebar in Image 2 appears slightly wider or has different internal padding for the "Quick Wins" list items compared to Image 1.
*   **Header Alignment:** The "Where your bytes sit on a timeline" subtitle in Image 2 is aligned differently relative to the toolbar above it compared to Image 1.

### Summary of Critical Action Items
1.  **Update Color Palette:** Change the "Scan" button to `#FF5F57`. Update all chart colors to match the pastel/vibrant palette of Image 1 (Mint, Sky Blue, Lavender, Pastel Pink, Salmon).
2.  **Fix Toolbar:** Restore the "Age Map" red toggle button. Remove "Cleanup" and "Free" from the top bar. Add the back arrow `<`.
3.  **Fix Right Panel:** Replace the "This PC" header/icon block with the "Library" text header. Remove the `C:\` input field. Remove the "Add to Cleanup" button. Update labels to match ("Compressed by").
4.  **Fix Visualizations:** 
    *   Make bar chart ends fully rounded (pill shape).
    *   Populate the calendar heatmap with blue data cells (remove the orange border selection).
    *   Adjust Donut chart stroke thickness to be bolder.
5.  **Remove Non-Target Elements:** Delete the "Big & Untouched" file list and the "File Types" sidebar section.
6.  **Content Sync:** Update all text values (file counts, GB sizes, dates) to match the specific data shown in Image 1.

═══════════ BUBBLES GAPS ═══════════
Based on a detailed comparison of the **Target (IMAGE 1)** and the **Current Implementation (IMAGE 2)**, here is an exhaustive audit of visual gaps and required fixes:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width & Content Density:** The left sidebar in IMAGE 2 is significantly wider than in IMAGE 1. The "Quick Wins" and "File Types" sections in IMAGE 2 have much more vertical padding between items, making the list feel sparse compared to the compact, information-dense layout of IMAGE 1.
*   **Main Visualization Area:** The bubble chart in IMAGE 2 is rendered as a single, large, solid light-blue circle with minimal internal detail, whereas IMAGE 1 shows a complex, multi-colored nested bubble hierarchy.
*   **Right Panel (Inspector) Layout:** 
    *   The header in IMAGE 2 ("This PC") includes a large folder icon that is absent in IMAGE 1 (which just uses text).
    *   IMAGE 2 has an extra text input field (`C:\`) below the header that does not exist in IMAGE 1.
    *   The "Details" section in IMAGE 2 lacks the clear horizontal divider lines seen in IMAGE 1.

### 2. Color Palette & Accents
*   **Primary Action Button:** 
    *   IMAGE 1: Bright, saturated Coral/Orange (`#FF6347` approx).
    *   IMAGE 2: Muted, darker Red-Orange (`#E85D40` approx). **Fix:** Increase saturation and brightness to match the vibrant target color.
*   **Bubble Chart Colors:** 
    *   IMAGE 1: Uses a diverse palette (Pastel Blue `#AEC6CF`, Mint Green `#98FF98`, Pale Yellow `#FFFACD`, Lavender `#E6E6FA`).
    *   IMAGE 2: Almost entirely monochromatic (Steel Blue/Grey `#B0C4DE`). **Fix:** Implement category-based coloring for bubbles.
*   **Text Accents:** 
    *   "Used" space in sidebar: IMAGE 1 is Red (`#FF4500`), IMAGE 2 is Dark Red (`#CC0000`).
    *   "Free" space in sidebar: IMAGE 1 is bright Green (`#32CD32`), IMAGE 2 is standard Green (`#228B22`). Match the lighter, more modern shades from IMAGE 1.
*   **Warning Banner:** IMAGE 1 uses a soft red background with a lock icon; IMAGE 2 uses a white background with a red warning triangle icon. **Fix:** Restore the subtle red tinted background and lock iconography.

### 3. Typography
*   **Font Family:** IMAGE 1 uses a clean San Francisco / Inter-style system font. IMAGE 2 appears to use Segoe UI or a similar Windows-standard font which looks slightly heavier/blockier.
*   **Header Hierarchy:** 
    *   In IMAGE 1, "Macintosh HD" is very large and bold, with stats inline.
    *   In IMAGE 2, "This PC" is smaller relative to the panel, and the stats look less integrated.
*   **Sidebar Labels:** The labels in IMAGE 2 ("DISK STORAGE", "CURRENT VIEW") appear to have slightly more letter-spacing or are bolder than the subtle grey caps in IMAGE 1.

### 4. Component Styling (UI Kits)
*   **Top Navigation Bar:**
    *   **Active State:** IMAGE 1 highlights the active tab ("Explore") with a solid pill-shaped orange background. IMAGE 2 uses a similar style but the shape/padding feels slightly different.
    *   **Icons:** The icons in IMAGE 2's top bar (Monitor, Snapshots) differ slightly in stroke weight from IMAGE 1.
*   **Toolbar (Below Header):**
    *   IMAGE 1 has a specific "Bubbles" toggle button (active state) with a distinct icon set (Grid, List, etc.).
    *   IMAGE 2 replaces this with generic view switchers and text toggles ("By folder", "By type"). **Fix:** Restore the specific icon toolbar and the prominent "Bubbles" mode selector.
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **"Reveal" / "Copy Path":** In IMAGE 1, these are outlined buttons with specific icon+text alignment. In IMAGE 2, they look like standard Windows styled buttons with heavier borders.
    *   **"Add to Cleanup":** This button exists in IMAGE 2 but is completely missing from IMAGE 1's inspector (which ends at "Copy Path"). If this is a feature addition, ensure its style matches the primary "Scan" button exactly.
*   **List Items (Quick Wins):** 
    *   IMAGE 1 uses colored square icons on the left of each list item.
    *   IMAGE 2 uses colored circle icons. **Fix:** Change circles to rounded squares to match target design.

### 5. Visualization Rendering (The Bubble Chart)
*   **Complexity:** IMAGE 1 shows a "Packed Circle" algorithm where large folders contain smaller sub-bubbles (e.g., "Users" contains "Library", "Applications", "Caches").
*   **Simplification:** IMAGE 2 renders a "Sunburst" or simple nested circle view where the inner content is mostly empty space or obscured. It lacks the dense clustering of small bubbles seen in IMAGE 1.
*   **Labels:** IMAGE 1 places text labels directly over or immediately adjacent to the bubbles ("Users", "Library", "private"). IMAGE 2 only labels the main center and one outer ring item ("Users"), leaving the rest unlabeled.
*   **Stroke/Borders:** Bubbles in IMAGE 1 often have subtle white separators or distinct color boundaries. IMAGE 2 bubbles blend into each other with low contrast.

### 6. Alignment & Spacing
*   **Sidebar Stats Alignment:** In IMAGE 1, the numbers (245 GB, 21 GB) are right-aligned against their labels. In IMAGE 2, the alignment looks looser.
*   **Inspector Panel Padding:** The right panel in IMAGE 2 has excessive whitespace around the "Largest Inside" section compared to the tight layout in IMAGE 1.
*   **Centering:** The main bubble chart in IMAGE 2 appears slightly off-center vertically within its container compared to IMAGE 1.

### 7. Missing Elements
*   **"Scan Full Mac" vs "Scan This PC":** Text difference (expected), but note the icon inside the button differs (Image vs Scan-tool icon).
*   **Recent Section:** IMAGE 1 has a "RECENT" list item above Disk Storage. IMAGE 2 replaces this with drive letters (`C:`, `D:`). **Fix:** Ensure this area adapts correctly to OS context but maintains the visual weight.
*   **File Types Section:** IMAGE 2 adds a "FILE TYPES" breakdown at the bottom of the sidebar that is not present in IMAGE 1. (Acceptable if intended as a platform feature, but breaks visual parity).
*   **Top Right Utilities:** IMAGE 1 has specific icons (Trash, Settings, etc.) in the top right corner. IMAGE 2 has "Cleanup", "Free", and a Moon icon (Dark mode?). **Fix:** Align utility icons with the target design's functionality or hide non-matching ones.
*   **Footer Status:** IMAGE 1 shows "15 cells" or similar status at the bottom of the chart area; IMAGE 2 shows "Local Disk (C:)".

═══════════ FLAME GAPS ═══════════
Here is the production-grade polish audit comparing **IMAGE 1 (Target)** against **IMAGE 2 (Current)**:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width & Content Density:** The left sidebar in IMAGE 1 is narrower and more compact. In IMAGE 2, the "Quick Wins" list is significantly longer (extending to "VM disks") and includes a new "FILE TYPES" section at the bottom that does not exist in IMAGE 1.
*   **Main Visualization Area:** The treemap in IMAGE 1 is wider relative to its height. IMAGE 2's treemap is taller and narrower, causing the folder blocks (e.g., `Users`, `dev`) to stack vertically rather than spreading horizontally as seen in the target.
*   **Right Panel Width:** The details panel in IMAGE 1 is wider, allowing for comfortable spacing in the "Largest Inside" list. IMAGE 2's right panel is slightly compressed.

### 2. Color Palette & Accents
*   **Treemap Color Scheme:** 
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Uses a vibrant, multi-colored palette (Sky Blue `#8ECAE6`, Mint Green `#A7F3D0`, Lavender `#DDD6FE`, Peach `#FED7AA`) to distinguish folders like `Applications` and `Library`.
    *   **IMAGE 2:** Uses a monochromatic, desaturated blue-grey palette (`#94A3B8` / `#CBD5E1`). This makes it very difficult to visually separate different directory structures.
*   **Warning Banner:**
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Light red background (`#FEF2F2`) with a dark red icon (`#EF4444`).
    *   **IMAGE 2:** White background with a light red icon (`#FCA5A5`). The banner lacks the subtle background tint of the target.
*   **Scan Button:** The orange gradient in IMAGE 1 (`#FF6B4A` to `#FF8A65`) is more saturated than the flatter orange used in IMAGE 2 (`#FF6B4A`).
*   **Text Colors:** The "Used" space text in the sidebar is bright red (`#EF4444`) in IMAGE 1 but appears as a darker, muted red in IMAGE 2.

### 3. Typography
*   **Header Hierarchy:** 
    *   **IMAGE 1:** "Macintosh HD" is large bold black; "162 GB" is standard weight grey.
    *   **IMAGE 2:** "This PC" is bold, but the stats ("129 GB") are styled identically to the header name, reducing visual hierarchy.
*   **Section Labels:** Labels like "DISK STORAGE", "CURRENT VIEW", and "DETAILS" are **all caps** and use a smaller font size (approx 11px) with wide letter-spacing in IMAGE 1. In IMAGE 2, these labels are mixed case or lack the distinct typographic styling (e.g., "Details" vs "DETAILS").
*   **Right Panel Header:** IMAGE 1 displays the full path `/Users/hariprasad/Library/Application Support/Google`. IMAGE 2 only shows `C:\`.

### 4. Component Styling
*   **Toolbar Controls:**
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Features a prominent "Flame" toggle button (pill-shaped, filled red).
    *   **IMAGE 2:** Missing the "Flame" button entirely. Replaced by generic view switchers and a depth slider (orange track) which is absent from the target design.
*   **Warning Banner Action:** IMAGE 1 has an "Open Privacy Settings" button inside the warning banner. IMAGE 2 only has a close 'X' button.
*   **Buttons:** 
    *   **Reveal/Copy Path:** In IMAGE 1, these are outlined buttons with icons on the left. In IMAGE 2, they look like standard ghost buttons with centered icons/text.
    *   **Quick Look:** Present in IMAGE 1 right panel; replaced by "Preview" in IMAGE 2.
*   **Top Navigation:** IMAGE 1 has a dropdown for the drive name ("Macintosh HD"). IMAGE 2 uses a back arrow `< This PC` breadcrumb style.

### 5. Visualization Rendering (The Treemap)
*   **Block Distribution:** IMAGE 1 shows `Users` taking up roughly the top-left 40%, with `Library` below it and `Applications` to the right. IMAGE 2 shows `Users` taking up almost the entire top half, pushing everything else down.
*   **Labels:** 
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Labels are placed *inside* the colored blocks (e.g., "Users", "hariprasad", "Library").
    *   **IMAGE 2:** Labels are placed *above* the blocks or in headers, leaving the blocks themselves mostly empty or with tiny text.
*   **Granularity:** IMAGE 1 shows fine-grained detail (many thin vertical strips representing small files). IMAGE 2 renders larger, chunkier blocks with fewer internal divisions.
*   **Gaps/Spacing:** IMAGE 1 uses consistent ~2px white gaps between all blocks. IMAGE 2 has inconsistent or non-existent gaps between major sections.

### 6. Alignment & Spacing
*   **Stats Row:** In IMAGE 1, the file/folder counts are aligned perfectly with the drive title baseline. In IMAGE 2, they appear slightly lower or misaligned.
*   **Sidebar Stats:** The alignment of "Total", "Used", "Free" values is right-aligned in IMAGE 1 but looks loosely aligned in IMAGE 2.
*   **Right Panel List:** The "Largest Inside" list in IMAGE 1 has generous padding. IMAGE 2's list items are cramped together.

### 7. Missing Elements
*   **"Flame" Button:** Completely missing from the main toolbar.
*   **"Open Privacy Settings" Button:** Missing from the alert banner.
*   **"Quick Look" Button:** Missing from the right-hand action menu.
*   **Drive Dropdown:** The top-center drive selector is replaced by a navigation path.
*   **Specific Sidebar Items:** "Caches & logs", "iOS Simulators", "Xcode DerivedData" are present in IMAGE 1 but replaced by different categories (Temp, VM disks, File Types) in IMAGE 2.
*   **Path Display:** The full file path above the "12.4 GB" / "129 GB" header is missing/truncated in IMAGE 2.

### Summary of Critical Fixes Needed:
1.  **Restore Color:** Implement the multi-color treemap scheme (Blue/Green/Purple) instead of monochrome grey.
2.  **Fix Treemap Logic:** Adjust the layout algorithm so `Users` doesn't dominate 50% of the screen; match the proportions of IMAGE 1.
3.  **Add Missing UI:** Reinstate the "Flame" button, "Open Privacy Settings" button, and "Quick Look" button.
4.  **Typography Overhaul:** Convert section headers ("DISK STORAGE", etc.) to uppercase with increased letter-spacing. Fix the header hierarchy (Title vs. Stats).
5.  **Layout Tuning:** Widen the right details panel and narrow the left sidebar to match IMAGE 1's aspect ratios.

═══════════ FOLDERS GAPS ═══════════
Based on a detailed visual audit of the **Target (Image 1)** vs. the **Current Implementation (Image 2)**, here is an exhaustive list of actionable fixes to achieve production-grade polish:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width & Spacing:** The left sidebar in Image 2 appears slightly narrower or has different internal padding than Image 1. Adjust the sidebar width to match the target's proportions.
*   **Main Content Grid:** Image 1 uses a 2-column grid for folder cards (Users, Applications, etc.). Image 2 shows only a single column for "Local Disk (C:)". Implement a responsive 2-column grid layout to match the target's density.
*   **Right Panel Width:** The details panel on the right in Image 2 seems to have more whitespace or different margins compared to Image 1. Tighten the alignment of the "Details" and "Largest Inside" sections.

### 2. Color Palette & Accents
*   **Primary Action Button:** The "Scan Full Mac" / "Scan This PC" button in Image 1 is a vibrant coral-orange (`#FF6B5B` approx). In Image 2, it is a duller, darker red-orange (`#E85D4F` approx). Update the hex code to match the brighter, more modern tone of the target.
*   **Folder Card Backgrounds:** 
    *   **Users:** Target is light periwinkle (`#DCE4FF`). Current is too blue (`#C5D9F8`).
    *   **Applications:** Target is mint green (`#CCFBF0`). Current is too cyan/teal.
    *   **Library:** Target is pale yellow (`#FFF9DB`). Current is acceptable but check saturation.
    *   **private:** Target is lavender (`#E8E0F0`). Current is missing this card entirely.
    *   **usr:** Target is pale pink (`#FFE4E6`). Current is missing.
    *   **opt:** Target is pale mint (`#D1FAE5`). Current is missing.
*   **Text Colors:** The "Used" storage text in Image 1 is red (`#FF3B30`), while in Image 2 it looks like a standard dark grey/black. Ensure "Used" is distinctly red and "Free" is green (`#34C759`) in the Disk Storage widget.
*   **Warning Banner:** Image 2 includes a red warning banner ("3 folders couldn't be read") which is absent in Image 1. If this is not intended functionality, remove it; if it is, style it to match the app's specific warning aesthetic (likely using the primary red).

### 3. Typography
*   **Header Hierarchy:** In Image 1, "Macintosh HD" is large and bold, followed by smaller stats. In Image 2, "This PC" feels slightly smaller or less bold. Increase the font weight/size of the main header.
*   **Stats Formatting:** Image 1 uses middle dots (`·`) as separators between GB, files, and folders. Ensure Image 2 uses the exact same separator character and spacing.
*   **Sidebar Labels:** Labels like "DISK STORAGE", "CURRENT VIEW", and "QUICK WINS" in Image 1 are uppercase with specific letter-spacing. Verify Image 2 matches this exact tracking and case.

### 4. Component Styling
*   **Navigation Bar:** 
    *   Image 1 has a clean segmented control look for "Explore", "Duplicates", etc., with "Explore" active (white text on orange pill).
    *   Image 2 adds a "DiskGenie" logo/text on the far left which shifts the layout. Remove the logo if strictly following Image 1, or ensure it doesn't compress the nav items.
    *   The "This PC" dropdown in Image 2 replaces the simple "Macintosh HD" text in Image 1. Style the dropdown trigger to look like the target's static text or adjust the target design if a dropdown is required.
*   **Toolbar Icons:** The toolbar below the header in Image 1 has a specific set of icons (Grid view, List view, etc.) inside a rounded container. Image 2 has different icons (including a flame icon?). Replace icons to match the target set exactly.
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **"Add to Cleanup":** In Image 1, this is a wide, soft pink/coral button at the bottom of the right panel. In Image 2, it is a solid orange/red block. Change the background color to the lighter salmon/pink shade (`#FFADA7` approx) and update the icon to a plus sign (Image 1) rather than a trash can (Image 2).
    *   **"Reveal" / "Copy Path":** These buttons in the sidebar and right panel should be outlined (ghost buttons) with consistent border radius. Image 2 looks correct here, but double-check the border color (should be light grey `#E5E5EA`).
*   **Folder Card Shapes:** The folder cards in Image 1 have a distinct "folder tab" shape at the top (a notch cut out). Image 2's card is a standard rounded rectangle. Implement the CSS `clip-path` or SVG background to create the folder tab effect.

### 5. Visualization Rendering
*   **Donut Chart:** 
    *   **Colors:** The ring in Image 1 is thick and bright orange. Image 2's ring is thinner and darker.
    *   **Center Text:** "90.5%" in Image 1 is bold and large. "88%" in Image 2 needs to match this weight.
    *   **Background:** The circle background in Image 1 is very light grey/off-white. Ensure Image 2 isn't using pure white.
*   **File Type Indicators:** Inside the folder cards, there are small colored dots representing file types (blue, green, yellow). Ensure these are rendered as small circles (approx 6-8px) with the correct colors matching the legend if one exists.

### 6. Alignment & Symmetry
*   **Right Panel Alignment:** In Image 1, the values in the "Details" list (e.g., "147 GB") are right-aligned perfectly. Check Image 2 for any misalignment in the "Largest Inside" or "Details" columns.
*   **Card Internal Padding:** The text "Users" and "109 GB" inside the cards in Image 1 has specific padding from the edges. Image 2 might have too much or too little padding, making the content feel uncentered vertically within the colored area.

### 7. Missing Elements
*   **Missing Folder Cards:** Image 2 is missing the following cards present in Image 1:
    *   **private** (Lavender)
    *   **usr** (Pink)
    *   **opt** (Mint)
    *   *(Note: Image 2 shows "Local Disk (C:)" instead of "Users". If this is a Windows vs Mac difference, ensure the visual style of the single card matches the multi-card grid style of the target).*
*   **Missing Sidebar Sections:** 
    *   Image 1 has a "RECENT" section above "DISK STORAGE".
    *   Image 1 lists specific items under Quick Wins like "Caches & logs", "node_modules", "Large media", "Build artifacts", "iOS Simulators", "Xcode DerivedData".
    *   Image 2 has "Temp & caches", "Developer caches", "VM disks", and a new "FILE TYPES" section at the bottom. Reconcile these lists to match the target data structure or styling.
*   **Path Display:** Image 1 shows a small path/breadcrumb area near the top right ("Macintosh HD > Folder"). Image 2 shows "C:\" in a box. Align this component's position and style.
*   **Top Right Utilities:** Image 1 has specific icons in the top right corner (bell, settings, etc.). Image 2 has "Cleanup", "Free", and a moon icon. Standardize the toolbar utilities.

### Summary of Critical Fixes:
1.  **Update Hex Codes:** Button (`#FF6B5B`), Folder Backgrounds (Pastel palette).
2.  **Implement Folder Tab Shape:** Use `clip-path` for the card tops.
3.  **Fix Layout Grid:** Switch to 2 columns for folders.
4.  **Icon Swap:** Update toolbar and action button icons (Plus vs Trash).
5.  **Typography Polish:** Bolden headers and fix stat separators.

═══════════ LIST GAPS ═══════════
Here is a comprehensive, production-grade audit of the visual gaps between the **Target (Image 1)** and the **Current Implementation (Image 2)**:

### 1. Global Layout & Header Structure
*   **Missing App Branding:** Image 2 is missing the "DiskGenie" logo and app name in the top-left corner (present in Image 1).
*   **Top Navigation Bar:** 
    *   The navigation items in Image 2 ("Explore", "Duplicates", etc.) lack the pill-shaped background container seen in Image 1.
    *   The active tab styling is incorrect: Image 1 uses a solid orange/red background with white text for the active state; Image 2 uses a lighter red/orange tint.
*   **Header Search & Actions:** 
    *   Image 2 is missing the specific icon group on the far right of the header (the bag/icon, settings gear, and sidebar toggle).
    *   The search bar in Image 2 has a "Ctrl+K" shortcut hint inside it, which is absent in Image 1.
    *   The dropdown selector in the center of the header says "This PC" in Image 2 vs "Macintosh HD" in Image 1 (expected content difference, but layout alignment differs slightly).

### 2. Left Sidebar (Navigation & Stats)
*   **Primary Action Button:** 
    *   Text mismatch: "Scan This PC" (Img 2) vs "Scan Full Mac" (Img 1).
    *   Icon mismatch: Image 2 uses a crosshair/scan icon; Image 1 uses a folder/magnifying glass icon.
*   **Location Shortcuts:** 
    *   Image 2 adds extra buttons ("C:", "D:") below "Home" and "Folder..." that do not exist in Image 1's layout.
*   **Disk Storage Widget:**
    *   **Chart Style:** Image 1 uses a solid donut chart with a thick stroke. Image 2 uses a thinner stroke with a distinct gap/split in the ring (indicating a different chart library or configuration).
    *   **Data Labels:** Image 1 aligns "Total", "Used", "Free" to the right. Image 2 aligns them to the right but the font weights and spacing differ slightly.
    *   **Colors:** The "Used" color in Image 1 is a vibrant red (`#FF4B4B` approx). In Image 2, it is a darker, more muted orange-red.
*   **Current View Section:**
    *   Image 2 includes a path string ("C:\") below the view title, which is not present in Image 1.
*   **Quick Wins List:**
    *   **Content/Icons:** The list items are completely different (e.g., "Caches & logs" vs "Downloads"). 
    *   **Visuals:** The icons in Image 2 are enclosed in light purple circular backgrounds. Image 1 uses colored square or rounded-square icons without a heavy background circle.
    *   **Missing Section:** Image 2 has an extra "FILE TYPES" section at the bottom of the sidebar that does not exist in Image 1.

### 3. Main Content Area (File List)
*   **Title & Metadata:**
    *   Font weight of "This PC" / "Macintosh HD" appears bolder in Image 1.
    *   Metadata (GB count, file count) alignment and separators (dots vs commas) differ.
*   **Toolbar:**
    *   **View Toggles:** Image 1 has a "List" button (active, orange). Image 2 replaces this with different icons (including a flame icon and a hierarchy tree icon) that are not present in Image 1.
    *   **Right Alignment:** Image 1 has text "Every item as an expandable outline" centered/right-aligned. Image 2 has this text plus a keyboard shortcut hint "A".
*   **Warning Banner:**
    *   **Icon:** Image 1 uses a red folder icon with a warning dot. Image 2 uses a standard red triangular warning icon.
    *   **Action:** Image 1 has an "Open Privacy Settings" button inside the banner. Image 2 lacks this button entirely.
    *   **Text:** The wording about "macOS denied access" (Img 1) vs "protected by the system" (Img 2) differs, but visually the text wrapping and padding inside the banner differ.
*   **List Table Header:**
    *   Image 2 explicitly shows column headers: "NAME", "SHARE", "%", "ITEMS", "SIZE". 
    *   Image 1 **does not** have these explicit text headers; it relies on implicit alignment. This is a major structural difference.
*   **List Items (Rows):**
    *   **Progress Bars:** In Image 1, the progress bars (representing share) are thin, subtle grey lines. In Image 2, the bar is thicker and blue/grey.
    *   **Data Density:** Image 1 shows many items (Users, Applications, private, Library, usr, opt...). Image 2 only shows one item ("Local Disk (C:)"). The visual rhythm of the list is broken because Image 2 looks empty compared to the dense target.

### 4. Right Sidebar (Details Panel)
*   **Header:**
    *   Image 1 shows a Folder icon + "Library" + "Folder" subtitle.
    *   Image 2 shows a Folder icon + "This PC" + "Folder" subtitle + a path input box below it. The input box is an extra element.
*   **Size Display:**
    *   **Font Size:** The large size text ("5.20 GB" vs "129 GB") in Image 1 is significantly larger and bolder than in Image 2.
    *   **Percentage:** Image 1 places the percentage ("3.2% of scan") inline with the size. Image 2 places it smaller and to the right ("100.0% of scan").
*   **Details Grid:**
    *   **Labels:** "Compressed by" (Img 1) vs "Compressed / sparse savings" (Img 2).
    *   **Values:** 
        *   "Logical size" value is green in Image 2, black in Image 1.
        *   "Of parent" value is "3.2%" in Img 1, "100.0%" in Img 2.
*   **Largest Inside Section:**
    *   Image 1 lists multiple sub-items (Developer, Application Support, Updates...) with colored dots.
    *   Image 2 lists only one item ("Local Disk (C:)").
    *   **Header Count:** Image 1 says "65 items", Image 2 says "1 Items" (grammar error in Img 2).
*   **Action Buttons (Bottom):**
    *   **Layout:** Image 1 has buttons arranged in a grid (2 columns roughly) or specific grouping. Image 2 has them stacked vertically or in a different arrangement.
    *   **Specifics:** 
        *   Image 1 has "Quick Look". Image 2 has "Preview".
        *   Image 1 ends with a truncated orange button (likely "Delete" or similar). 
        *   Image 2 ends with a full-width orange button labeled "**Add to Cleanup**" with a trash icon. This button style (full width, specific label) does not match Image 1.

### 5. Typography & Color Palette
*   **Primary Action Color:** 
    *   Target (Img 1): Bright Coral/Orange (`#FF6347` or similar).
    *   Current (Img 2): Darker, more muted Tomato/Red-Orange (`#E74C3C` or similar).
*   **Text Colors:**
    *   The "Free" space in the sidebar is Green in both, but the shade differs (lighter mint in Img 1, darker green in Img 2).
    *   The "Used" space is Red in Img 1, Dark Orange in Img 2.
*   **Fonts:** 
    *   Image 1 appears to use a system font (likely San Francisco on macOS) which is slightly crisper. 
    *   Image 2 looks like it might be using a default Windows UI font (Segoe UI) or a web font that renders slightly heavier/different.

### 6. Summary of Critical Fixes
1.  **Restore Header Layout:** Add back the Logo, fix the Nav Pill container, and restore the right-side icon cluster.
2.  **Fix Sidebar Chart:** Change the Donut chart to a solid ring (no gap), update colors to match the brighter Red/Green palette, and remove the "FILE TYPES" section.
3.  **Remove Table Headers:** Remove the "NAME", "SHARE", "%" headers from the main list view to match the cleaner look of Image 1.
4.  **Update Warning Banner:** Swap the triangle icon for the folder icon and add the "Open Privacy Settings" button.
5.  **Polish Right Panel:** Increase the font size of the main size statistic ("129 GB"), remove the path input field, and change the bottom action button from "Add to Cleanup" to match the target design (likely just an icon or different label).
6.  **Color Correction:** Lighten the primary "Scan" button and accent colors to match the vibrant tone of Image 1.
7.  **Toolbar Sync:** Replace the "Flame" and "Tree" icons in the main toolbar with the "List" toggle button seen in Image 1.

═══════════ MINDMAP GAPS ═══════════
Here is a comprehensive, production-grade audit of the visual gaps between the **Target (Image 1)** and the **Current Implementation (Image 2)**:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width & Proportions:** The left sidebar in Image 1 is significantly wider relative to the main content area. In Image 2, the sidebar is too narrow, causing the "Quick Wins" list items to wrap text awkwardly (e.g., "Developer caches", "VM disks").
*   **Right Panel Width:** The right details panel in Image 1 is wider, allowing for a cleaner two-column layout in the "Details" section. Image 2's panel is narrower, forcing labels and values into a tighter space.
*   **Header Bar:** 
    *   Image 1 has a clean, minimal header with the app name/logo on the far left.
    *   Image 2 includes extra buttons ("Cleanup", "Free") and window controls (minimize/maximize/close) that are absent or styled differently in the target.
*   **Main Content Header:**
    *   Image 1 uses a large, bold title ("Macintosh HD") with stats inline.
    *   Image 2 uses a smaller title ("This PC") with a different icon placement.
    *   The toolbar below the title is completely different. Image 1 has a segmented control for view modes (Mind Map selected). Image 2 has a different set of icons and a tabbed interface ("By folder", "By type", "By age").

### 2. Color Palette & Accents
*   **Primary Action Button:** 
    *   Target (Image 1): Bright, vibrant orange-red (`#FF6B4A` or similar).
    *   Current (Image 2): Duller, more muted red-orange (`#F26B4E`).
*   **Visualization Colors:**
    *   Target: Uses a vibrant, multi-colored spectrum (Pink, Green, Blue, Purple, Yellow) to distinguish branches.
    *   Current: Uses a monochromatic, desaturated blue-grey palette (`#B8C9D8` for the center, `#DCE4EB` for outer nodes). It lacks the color-coding entirely.
*   **Text Colors:**
    *   Target: Uses high-contrast black for values.
    *   Current: Uses a lighter grey for some values, reducing readability.
*   **Status Colors:**
    *   Target: "Used" space is red (`#FF3B30`), "Free" is green (`#34C759`).
    *   Current: "Used" is a darker red (`#D93B3B`), "Free" is a slightly duller green.

### 3. Typography
*   **Font Family:** Image 1 appears to use a system font like San Francisco (macOS) or Inter—very clean and geometric. Image 2 looks like it might be using Segoe UI (Windows default), which has different metrics (height, spacing).
*   **Hierarchy:**
    *   The "5.20 GB" / "129 GB" header in the right panel is much larger and bolder in Image 1.
    *   Section headers like "DISK STORAGE", "QUICK WINS", and "LARGEST INSIDE" are bolder and more prominent in Image 1.

### 4. Component Styling
*   **The Visualization (Mind Map vs. Sunburst/Radial):** 
    *   **Target (Image 1):** A complex **Radial Treemap / Mind Map**. It shows hierarchical branching with labeled nodes (Library, Users, Applications, opt, usr, var). Lines connect nodes to the center.
    *   **Current (Image 2):** A simplified **Sunburst Chart** or nested circle diagram. It lacks the branching lines, specific folder labels on nodes, and the "tree" structure. It looks like a single level of depth or a very simplified radial layout.
*   **Buttons:**
    *   **"Scan Full/This PC":** Image 1 has rounded corners (approx 8-10px radius) and a solid fill. Image 2 has sharper corners (approx 4px).
    *   **Secondary Buttons ("Reveal", "Copy Path"):** Image 1 uses outlined buttons with grey borders. Image 2 uses white/grey filled buttons with subtle borders.
    *   **Right Panel Buttons:** Image 1 has "Reveal", "Quick Look", "Focus", "Copy Path". Image 2 replaces these with "Preview" and adds a large, prominent "Add to Cleanup" button at the bottom which doesn't exist in the target design.
*   **Warning Banner:**
    *   Image 1: Red icon, bold text, includes an "Open Privacy Settings" action button.
    *   Image 2: Red icon, standard text, no action button, just a close 'X'.
*   **Progress Ring (Disk Storage):**
    *   Image 1: Thicker stroke, vibrant colors, "90.1%" text is large and centered inside.
    *   Image 2: Thinner stroke, "88%" text is smaller.
*   **List Items (Quick Wins/Largest Inside):**
    *   Image 1: Clean rows with icons on the left, title, item count in grey, size in black, and a chevron `>` on the right.
    *   Image 2: Similar but the alignment of the chevron and the spacing between items feels tighter/less airy.

### 5. Visualization Rendering Details
*   **Labels:** Image 1 has clear text labels on almost every major branch (e.g., "Library 12.0 GB", "Users", "Applications"). Image 2 only has one label "Local Disk (C:)" floating near the center.
*   **Center Node:** 
    *   Image 1: Orange circle with white text ("Macintosh HD 162 GB").
    *   Image 2: Light blue circle with dark text ("Local Disk (C:)").
*   **Branching Logic:** Image 1 shows actual file system hierarchy (usr -> lib, opt; Users -> hariprasad, Xcode.app). Image 2 shows generic circular segments without clear hierarchical meaning in the visual structure shown.

### 6. Alignment & Spacing
*   **Padding:** The main content area in Image 1 has generous padding around the visualization. Image 2's visualization feels cramped against the edges of its container.
*   **Grid Alignment:** In Image 1, the "Details" section in the right panel is perfectly aligned into two columns (Label | Value). In Image 2, the values are right-aligned but the overall block feels less structured because of the missing "Compressed by" row and different label lengths.

### 7. Missing Elements in Image 2
*   **"Mind Map" Toggle:** The central UI element for switching views is missing/replaced by tabs.
*   **"Open Privacy Settings" Button:** Missing from the warning banner.
*   **"Quick Look" Button:** Missing from the right panel actions.
*   **"Compressed by" Row:** Missing from the Details section in the right panel.
*   **"Of parent" Percentage:** Present in Image 1 (3.2%), missing in Image 2 (shows 100.00% instead, which is logically different).
*   **Recent Locations:** Image 1 shows "RECENT" with "Macintosh HD" below Home/Folder. Image 2 shows drive letters (C:, D:) in that spot.
*   **File Types Section:** Image 2 has an entire "FILE TYPES" section at the bottom of the sidebar (Archives, System, Documents, etc.) that is completely absent from Image 1.
*   **Top Navigation Items:** Image 1 ends at "Snapshots". Image 2 has "This PC" as a breadcrumb/tab after Snapshots.

### Summary of Critical Fixes Needed:
1.  **Replace the Sunburst chart with a Radial Treemap/Mind Map** that supports multi-colored branches and node labeling.
2.  **Update the Color Scheme** to the vibrant orange/red primary and multi-color chart palette.
3.  **Widen the Sidebar** and adjust typography to match the macOS-style layout of the target.
4.  **Rebuild the Right Panel** to include the correct "Details" rows, remove "Add to Cleanup", and restore the "Quick Look" button.
5.  **Fix the Header/Toolbar** to match the "Scan Full Mac" style and view switcher.

═══════════ SUNBURST GAPS ═══════════
Here is a comprehensive, production-grade audit of the visual gaps between the **Target (Image 1)** and **Current Implementation (Image 2)**:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width:** The left sidebar in Image 1 is significantly narrower than in Image 2. Reduce the sidebar width to match the compact "Macintosh HD" layout.
*   **Main Content Area:** The central visualization area in Image 1 is wider and more dominant. In Image 2, the chart is compressed and pushed down.
*   **Right Panel Width:** The details panel on the right is narrower in Image 1. Image 2’s panel is too wide, eating into the chart space.
*   **Header Layout:** 
    *   Image 1 has a clean, centered title area with stats inline (`162 GB • 16,47,622 files...`).
    *   Image 2 uses a bulkier header with the title and stats stacked or spaced differently.
*   **Toolbar Arrangement:** 
    *   Image 1 features a segmented control for view modes (`Sunburst` is selected with a pill shape).
    *   Image 2 uses individual icon buttons and a different set of controls (includes a slider for "Rings radiating out" which is absent in Image 1).
*   **Sidebar Sections:** 
    *   Image 1 has a "RECENT" section at the top of the sidebar.
    *   Image 2 replaces this with drive shortcuts (`C:`, `D:`) and adds a "FILE TYPES" section at the bottom which is missing from Image 1's sidebar.

### 2. Color Palette & Theming
*   **Visualization Colors (Critical):** 
    *   **Image 1:** Uses a vibrant, categorical color palette (Greens for Google/Dev tools, Blues for System/Library, Purples for Apps, Yellows/Oranges for Caches). Each segment is distinct.
    *   **Image 2:** Uses a monochromatic grayscale/blue-scale palette. It looks like a "default" unstyled state. **Fix:** Implement the specific HSL color mapping seen in Image 1.
*   **Accent Color:**
    *   **Image 1:** Uses a bright, saturated Orange-Red (`#FF5F57` or similar) for the primary "Scan" button and progress ring.
    *   **Image 2:** Uses a slightly duller, more standard orange/red. Match the hex code exactly.
*   **Backgrounds:**
    *   **Image 1:** The main background is pure white (`#FFFFFF`). The sidebar is a very light gray (`#F5F5F7`).
    *   **Image 2:** The background appears to have a cooler, slightly blue-tinted gray tone. Ensure backgrounds are #FFFFFF and #F8F8F8 respectively.

### 3. Typography
*   **Font Family:** Image 1 uses San Francisco (macOS system font). Image 2 appears to use Segoe UI (Windows default). While OS-dependent, ensure weights match:
    *   **Headings ("Macintosh HD"):** Bold, Semibold.
    *   **Stats (162 GB):** Large, heavy weight.
    *   **Labels ("DISK STORAGE", "Details"):** Uppercase, small size (~11px), medium gray, with generous letter-spacing.
*   **Text Alignment:** In Image 1, the center of the sunburst chart contains text ("Macintosh HD", "162 GB") centered perfectly. Image 2 has an empty white hole in the center.

### 4. Component Styling & UI Elements
*   **Primary Button ("Scan Full Mac" vs "Scan This PC"):**
    *   **Image 1:** Full width of the sidebar, rounded corners (approx 6-8px), white icon + bold text.
    *   **Image 2:** Looks similar but check corner radius and internal padding.
*   **Navigation Tabs (Top Left):**
    *   **Image 1:** "Explore" is a solid red pill button. Others are text only.
    *   **Image 2:** "Explore" is a solid red pill, but the styling of the inactive tabs differs slightly in weight/color.
*   **Progress Ring (Disk Storage):**
    *   **Image 1:** Thick stroke, vibrant orange/red track, white background inside, percentage text ("90.1%") is bold and black.
    *   **Image 2:** The ring looks thinner or the colors are less saturated. The "88%" text placement needs verification against Image 1.
*   **Warning Banner:**
    *   **Image 1:** Light red background (`#FFEFEF`), red icon, red text. Includes an "Open Privacy Settings" button inside the banner.
    *   **Image 2:** White background, red icon/text. Missing the action button inside the banner.
*   **List Items (Quick Wins / Largest Inside):**
    *   **Image 1:** Clean rows with a subtle hover state implied, right-aligned values (e.g., "18.0 GB"), gray metadata text ("318 items").
    *   **Image 2:** Similar, but check the iconography. Image 1 uses colorful folder icons; Image 2 uses monochrome or system-default icons.
*   **Action Buttons (Bottom of Right Panel):**
    *   **Image 1:** "Reveal", "Quick Look", "Focus", "Copy Path" are outlined/ghost buttons. "Add to Cleanup" is solid red.
    *   **Image 2:** "Reveal", "Preview", "Focus", "Copy Path". Note: Image 1 has "Quick Look", Image 2 has "Preview". Button grid layout (2x2) matches, but styling of the ghost buttons needs to be lighter/more subtle to match Image 1.

### 5. Visualization Rendering (The Sunburst Chart)
*   **Color Coding:** As mentioned in point 2, the chart in Image 2 is grayscale. It must be multi-colored based on file type/folder.
*   **Center Hole (Donut):** 
    *   **Image 1:** Contains the root folder name and total size.
    *   **Image 2:** Is empty white space. **Fix:** Render the center labels.
*   **Segment Labels:** 
    *   **Image 1:** Labels are written radially along the segments (e.g., "Google", "Library", "Caches").
    *   **Image 2:** No text labels are visible on the segments.
*   **Stroke/Gaps:** Image 1 has thin white strokes (approx 1-2px) separating segments for clarity. Image 2 appears to have these, but they are less visible due to the low-contrast color scheme.
*   **Data Density:** Image 1 shows many more small segments (the "spiky" outer ring). Image 2 looks smoother/simpler, possibly aggregating data too aggressively or missing small files.

### 6. Alignment & Spacing
*   **Chart Centering:** In Image 2, the sunburst chart appears shifted slightly to the left or top compared to the perfect centering in Image 1.
*   **Padding:** The padding between the chart and the warning banner in Image 1 is larger. Image 2 feels more cramped vertically.
*   **Right Panel Alignment:** The "Details" header and the list items in Image 2 should align strictly with the "Google" header above it. Check for pixel-perfect left alignment.

### 7. Missing Elements
*   **"Sunburst" Control:** Image 1 has a prominent "Sunburst" toggle/button in the toolbar. Image 2 lacks this specific labeled control.
*   **"By type / By folder / By age" Radio Group:** Image 1 has this clearly visible below the toolbar icons. Image 2 has "By folder", "By type", "By age" as text buttons/tabs, but the style is different (Image 1 looks like radio buttons or a segmented control).
*   **"Open Privacy Settings" Button:** Inside the red warning banner (mentioned in point 4).
*   **"Quick Look" Button:** Replaced by "Preview" in Image 2.
*   **Specific Sidebar Items:** "Caches & logs", "iOS Simulators", "Xcode DerivedData" present in Image 1 are replaced or missing in Image 2's "Quick Wins" list.
*   **Top Right Window Controls:** Image 1 has the standard macOS traffic lights (hidden/inset style) or specific app icons. Image 2 has Windows-style minimize/maximize/close. (Note: This may be OS-dependent, but worth noting for visual parity if aiming for a cross-platform unified design).

### Summary of Critical Action Items:
1.  **Implement the Multi-Color Sunburst Logic:** Replace the grayscale chart with the categorical color palette (Green/Blue/Purple/Yellow).
2.  **Add Center Labels:** Populate the donut hole with "This PC" (or root name) and Total Size.
3.  **Add Radial Labels:** Render text on the chart segments.
4.  **Restyle Toolbar:** Add the "Sunburst" segmented control and fix the "By folder/type/age" control to match the pill/radio style.
5.  **Fix Warning Banner:** Add the "Open Privacy Settings" button and change background to light red.
6.  **Adjust Layout Metrics:** Narrow the sidebar, widen the chart area, narrow the right panel.
7.  **Typography Polish:** Increase letter-spacing on uppercase headers ("DISK STORAGE", "DETAILS"). Ensure font weights match the bolder look of Image 1.

═══════════ TOPSIZES GAPS ═══════════
Here is a comprehensive, production-grade audit of the visual gaps between the **Target (Image 1)** and **Current (Image 2)** implementations:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width:** The left sidebar in Image 2 is noticeably wider than in Image 1. The target uses a more compact sidebar width (approx. 260px vs ~300px).
*   **Right Panel Width:** The right details panel ("Library" / "This PC") is significantly wider in Image 2, pushing the main content area inward.
*   **Main Content Area:** Due to the wider sidebars, the central file list in Image 2 has less horizontal real estate compared to the spacious layout in Image 1.
*   **Header Layout:** 
    *   Image 1 has a centered "Macintosh HD" title with stats inline.
    *   Image 2 has a left-aligned "This PC" title.
    *   The toolbar buttons below the header are spaced differently; Image 1 groups them tightly on the left with "Top Sizes" highlighted, while Image 2 spreads them out and lacks the specific "Top Sizes" toggle state.

### 2. Color Palette & Theming
*   **Selection Highlight Color:** 
    *   **Image 1:** Uses a soft, light **lavender/purple** (`#E8E0F0` approx) for selected rows (e.g., "Library").
    *   **Image 2:** Uses a standard, colder **light blue** (`#D6EAF8` approx) for the selected row ("Local Disk (C:)"). This is a major brand/theming deviation.
*   **Accent/Action Colors:**
    *   **Image 1:** Uses a vibrant **Coral/Orange-Red** (`#FF6347` or `#F05A28`) for primary actions ("Scan Full Mac").
    *   **Image 2:** Uses a flatter, slightly more muted **Orange-Red** (`#FA6439`).
*   **Text Colors:**
    *   **Warning Banner:** Image 1 uses black text for the warning message. Image 2 uses bold black for the headline but standard weight for the subtext.
    *   **Stats Text:** In Image 1, "Used" space is Red (`#FF3B30`) and "Free" is Green (`#34C759`). Image 2 matches this, but the specific hex shades may differ slightly in saturation.

### 3. Typography
*   **Header Hierarchy:** 
    *   Image 1: "Macintosh HD" is large and bold, followed by smaller grey metadata (`162 GB • 16,47,622 files...`).
    *   Image 2: "This PC" is bold, but the metadata font size and spacing feel slightly different (tighter).
*   **Right Panel Header:** 
    *   Image 1: "5.20 GB" is massive (approx 32px+), acting as a clear visual anchor.
    *   Image 2: "129 GB" is large but appears slightly smaller or less heavy than the target.
*   **List Typography:** The file list in Image 1 uses a crisp sans-serif (likely SF Pro). Image 2 looks like Segoe UI or similar; the line height and letter spacing in the list items differ, making Image 1 look more "airy."

### 4. Component Styling & UI Elements
*   **Primary Button ("Scan"):**
    *   **Image 1:** "Scan Full Mac" - Full width of sidebar, rounded corners (approx 8-10px), white icon + text.
    *   **Image 2:** "Scan This PC" - Similar style, but corner radius might be slightly sharper or padding different.
*   **Navigation Tabs (Top):**
    *   **Image 1:** "Explore" is an active **Pill-shaped button** (filled orange background, white text). Other tabs are text-only.
    *   **Image 2:** "Explore" is also a pill, but the inactive tabs have icons that look slightly misaligned or differently sized compared to the active state.
*   **Warning Banner:**
    *   **Image 1:** Light red/orange background (`#FFF0EF`), includes an **"Open Privacy Settings" button** inside the banner, and a detailed explanation about "macOS denied access."
    *   **Image 2:** Light grey/red background, **no action button** inside the banner, just a close 'X' and simpler text ("These folders are protected by the system").
*   **Disk Storage Widget (Donut Chart):**
    *   **Image 1:** Thick stroke donut, percentage ("90.1%") is large and bold inside. Colors are vibrant Orange (used) and light Grey (remaining).
    *   **Image 2:** The chart looks similar, but the inner text "88%" and the stroke width/proportions are not identical. The "Total/Used/Free" labels alignment to the right of the chart differs.
*   **Right Panel Actions:**
    *   **Image 1:** Has "Reveal", "Quick Look", "Focus", "Copy Path". Buttons are outlined/grey.
    *   **Image 2:** Has "Reveal", "Preview", "Focus", "Copy Path". Notably adds a large **"Add to Cleanup"** (orange) button at the bottom which is **absent in Image 1**.
*   **Quick Wins Section:**
    *   **Image 1:** Items like "Caches & logs", "Large media".
    *   **Image 2:** Items include "Temp & caches", "Developer caches", "VM disks", and a whole new **"FILE TYPES"** section below it (Archives, System, Documents, etc.) which does not exist in Image 1's sidebar.

### 5. Visualization & Data Rendering
*   **File List Columns:**
    *   **Image 1:** Shows Rank (#), Folder Icon, Name, File Count, Percentage (%), Size (GB). It displays **12 items**.
    *   **Image 2:** Shows Rank (#), Folder Icon, Name, Percentage (%), Size (GB). **Missing the "File Count" column** entirely. It only shows **1 item** (because it's the root view), but the column structure is fundamentally different.
*   **Row Styling:**
    *   **Image 1:** Rows have a subtle border-bottom or separator. The selected row ("Library") has a distinct purple tint and a **border/left-indicator** (subtle).
    *   **Image 2:** Selected row ("Local Disk (C:)") has a blue tint. No visible left-border indicator on selection.
*   **Details Panel Content:**
    *   **Image 1:** Shows "Compressed by: 3.27 GB" (Green text). Shows "Largest Inside" as a list with colored dots (Developer, Application Support, etc.).
    *   **Image 2:** Shows "Compressed / spare savings: 38.0 GB". Shows "Largest Inside" but with different data structure (just one item).

### 6. Alignment & Spacing Issues
*   **Header Stats Alignment:** In Image 1, the stats next to "Macintosh HD" are perfectly middle-aligned with the title. In Image 2, the stats next to "This PC" appear slightly lower or the baseline grid is off.
*   **Toolbar Alignment:** The toolbar row in Image 1 has the view toggles (grid/list icons) grouped left, and "The biggest items, ranked" text floating right. In Image 2, the sort/view icons are centered or spaced differently, and the right-aligned text "The biggest items, ranked" has a sort icon ('A') next to it that isn't in Image 1.
*   **Padding in Right Panel:** The padding around the "5.20 GB" / "129 GB" header in the right panel is generous in Image 1. In Image 2, it feels tighter vertically.

### 7. Missing or Extra Elements
*   **Missing in Image 2:**
    *   **"Open Privacy Settings" button** inside the warning alert.
    *   **"File Count" column** in the main table.
    *   **"Quick Look" button** in the right panel (replaced by "Preview").
    *   **"Top Sizes"** specific toggle state in the toolbar (Image 1 has it active/colored; Image 2 doesn't show this state).
    *   **"Snapshots"** tab in the top nav is present in both, but the icon differs slightly.
*   **Extra in Image 2 (Not in Target):**
    *   **"Add to Cleanup"** button in the right panel.
    *   **"Cleanup"** button and **"Free"** toggle in the top-right search bar area.
    *   **"FILE TYPES"** entire section in the left sidebar.
    *   **"Preview"** button (vs "Quick Look").
    *   **Path bar** below "This PC" in the right panel showing `C:\`.
    *   **Window Controls:** Image 2 shows standard Windows minimize/maximize/close controls; Image 1 shows macOS traffic lights (implied by design language, though cropped).

### Summary of Critical Actionable Fixes:
1.  **Change Selection Color:** Update list selection from Blue to **Lavender/Purple** (`#EDE7F6` range).
2.  **Fix Warning Banner:** Add the **"Open Privacy Settings"** button back into the alert and restore the original copy/text hierarchy.
3.  **Restore Column Structure:** Add the **"Files" (count)** column back to the main data table.
4.  **Adjust Sidebar Widths:** Reduce left sidebar and right panel widths to match Image 1 proportions.
5.  **Update Right Panel:** Remove "Add to Cleanup" button, change "Preview" back to **"Quick Look"**, and remove the `C:\` path bar.
6.  **Typography Pass:** Increase font weight/size of the right panel's main size stat ("129 GB") and ensure header metadata alignment matches Image 1.
7.  **Icon Consistency:** Ensure the "Explore" active tab and toolbar icons match the exact SVG paths/strokes from Image 1 (especially the "Top Sizes" chip if applicable).
8.  **Color Accuracy:** Tune the "Scan" button orange and the "Used/Free" storage text colors to match the hex codes in Image 1 exactly.

═══════════ TREEMAP GAPS ═══════════
Here is a comprehensive, production-grade audit of the visual gaps between the **Target (IMAGE 1)** and **Current (IMAGE 2)** implementations:

### 1. Layout & Structural Differences
*   **Sidebar Width & Proportions:** The left sidebar in IMAGE 2 is significantly narrower than in IMAGE 1. The "Disk Storage" circular gauge and "Quick Wins" list are compressed.
*   **Treemap Container Height:** The treemap visualization area in IMAGE 2 is much taller (extending further down the screen) relative to the sidebar, whereas IMAGE 1 has a more balanced, contained height for the treemap block.
*   **Right Panel Width:** The details panel on the right in IMAGE 2 appears slightly wider or the content is more spread out compared to the tighter layout of IMAGE 1.
*   **Header Layout:** 
    *   IMAGE 2 includes a "DiskGenie" app logo/title on the far left of the top nav bar, which is absent in IMAGE 1.
    *   The "Scan Full Mac" button text in IMAGE 2 reads "**Scan This PC**".
    *   The navigation path breadcrumb in the header center differs (`Macintosh HD` vs `This PC` with a back arrow).
*   **Missing Sidebar Sections:** IMAGE 2 has an extra section at the bottom of the sidebar titled "**FILE TYPES**" (listing Archives, System, Documents, etc.) which does not exist in IMAGE 1.

### 2. Color & Visualization Palette
*   **Treemap Color Scheme:** This is the most glaring difference.
    *   **IMAGE 1 (Target):** Uses a vibrant, distinct pastel palette (Cyan/Teal for 'Users', Light Blue for 'Library', Lime Green for 'Applications', Yellow for 'Library' sub-items, Pink/Purple for 'private'). Blocks have high contrast and clear category separation.
    *   **IMAGE 2 (Current):** Uses a monochromatic, desaturated grey-blue scale. Almost all blocks are shades of slate/blue-grey (`#B0BEC5`, `#CFD8DC`, `#90A4AE`). There is almost no color differentiation between folders like "Users", "Windows", or "Program Files".
*   **Accent Colors:**
    *   **Warning Banner:** IMAGE 1 uses a soft red/orange background (`#FFEBEE`) with a red lock icon. IMAGE 2 uses a plain light grey background (`#F5F5F5`) with a red warning triangle icon.
    *   **Selection Highlight:** In IMAGE 1, the selected folder ("Google") has a dark navy/black border. In IMAGE 2, the selection highlight is a bright, solid blue fill (`#2196F3`) covering the entire block, which looks like a default system selection rather than a styled UI state.

### 3. Typography & Text Content
*   **Header Statistics:** 
    *   IMAGE 1: `162 GB • 16,47,622 files • 2,20,118 folders`
    *   IMAGE 2: `129 GB • 1,546 files • 55 folders` (Different data, different formatting—IMAGE 2 uses middle dots, IMAGE 1 uses spaces/dots).
*   **Right Panel Header:** 
    *   IMAGE 1 shows "Google" (Folder name) and path `/Users/hariorasad/Library/Application Support/Google`.
    *   IMAGE 2 shows "This PC" (Folder name) and path `C:\`.
*   **Details Panel Labels:** 
    *   IMAGE 1 lists "Compressed by", "Of parent" (%), "Modified", "Created".
    *   IMAGE 2 replaces these with "Compressed / sparse savings", "Files" (count), "Folders" (count). The values also differ (e.g., "Just now" vs "16 seconds ago").
*   **Largest Inside List:** 
    *   IMAGE 1 shows a list of 6 specific files/folders (Chrome, GoogleUpdater, RLZ, etc.) with colored dots.
    *   IMAGE 2 shows only 1 item ("Local Disk (C:)") and labels the count as "1 Items".

### 4. Component Styling & Controls
*   **Toolbar Buttons (below Title):**
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Features a primary orange "**Treemap**" toggle button (active state) followed by icon-only buttons for other views.
    *   **IMAGE 2:** Lacks the primary "Treemap" button entirely. It shows text buttons/toggles for "By folder", "By type", "By age" and a slider. The view switcher icons are different (folder icon, clock, grid, etc.).
*   **Slider Control:** 
    *   IMAGE 1 has a simple blue progress bar/slider.
    *   IMAGE 2 has a prominent orange/red range slider with a thumb handle, looking more like a filter control than a depth/scale indicator.
*   **Top Right Actions:** 
    *   IMAGE 1 has icons for User, Settings (gear), Grid view toggle.
    *   IMAGE 2 adds text labels to some actions: "**Cleanup**", "**Free**", and a history/clock icon.
*   **Buttons in Details Panel:**
    *   IMAGE 1 has: Reveal, Quick Look, Focus, Copy Path, Add to Cleanup.
    *   IMAGE 2 has: Reveal, **Preview** (instead of Quick Look), Focus, Copy Path, Add to Cleanup. The icons for "Reveal" and "Preview" differ slightly in style.
*   **Sidebar Drive Indicators:** IMAGE 2 shows small drive icons (e.g., `C:`, `D:`) under the Home/Folder buttons; IMAGE 1 does not.

### 5. Visualization Rendering (Treemap)
*   **Block Styling (The "Look"):**
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Blocks look like floating cards with rounded corners (approx 4-6px radius), subtle white borders/gaps between them, and soft drop shadows. Labels are clearly legible inside the blocks.
    *   **IMAGE 2:** Blocks are sharp rectangles (0px radius) with thin white grid lines separating them. It resembles a strict geometric grid rather than a modern card-based treemap.
*   **Labels & Readability:**
    *   **IMAGE 1:** Uses bold text for folder names (e.g., "**Users**", "**Documents**") and smaller grey text for size (e.g., "11.8 GB"). Background colors are light enough for black text.
    *   **IMAGE 2:** Text is often cramped. Because the background is medium-grey, contrast is lower. Some labels are truncated differently.
*   **Selected State:** As noted above, IMAGE 2 uses a solid blue flood-fill for selection, whereas IMAGE 1 uses a stroke/border approach that preserves the internal color coding.

### 6. Alignment & Spacing
*   **Padding:** The padding inside the main content area (between the treemap and the panel edges) feels tighter in IMAGE 2.
*   **Grid Gaps:** The whitespace between treemap rectangles is uniform and grid-like in IMAGE 2, whereas IMAGE 1 has organic, varying gaps that suggest a layout engine with margins/shadows.
*   **Warning Banner Alignment:** In IMAGE 1, the "Open Privacy Settings" button is inside the banner on the right. In IMAGE 2, the banner is simpler text with just a close 'X' on the right.

### 7. Missing Elements
*   **"Treemap" Active Button:** The orange pill-shaped button indicating the current view mode is missing from the toolbar in IMAGE 2.
*   **Specific Data Fields:** "Compressed by", "Of parent" percentage, "Modified" (relative time), "Created" (relative time) are missing or replaced in the right-hand details panel of IMAGE 2.
*   **Color Coding Legend/Logic:** The entire semantic color scheme (Blue=Users, Green=Apps, etc.) present in IMAGE 1 is absent from IMAGE 2's rendering.

### Summary of Critical Fixes Required:
1.  **Implement the Pastel Color Palette:** Replace the grey-scale treemap with the distinct cyan/blue/green/yellow/pink categories seen in IMAGE 1.
2.  **Update Treemap Geometry:** Add rounded corners (approx 4-6px) and subtle shadows/gaps to the treemap blocks to match the "card" aesthetic of IMAGE 1.
3.  **Fix Selection Style:** Change the selection highlight from solid blue fill to a dark border/stroke overlay.
4.  **Restore Toolbar:** Add back the orange "Treemap" active button and adjust the toolbar icons to match IMAGE 1 (remove the red slider or restyle it to the blue line).
5.  **Sync Details Panel:** Update the right panel fields to show "Compressed by", "Of parent", "Modified", and "Created". Update the "Largest Inside" list to show multiple items with colored dots.
6.  **Adjust Colors & Icons:** Fix the warning banner background to light red/pink. Ensure the "Scan" button says "Scan Full Mac" (or appropriate OS equivalent) and matches the exact orange shade (`#FF7043` approx).
7.  **Remove "File Types" Section:** Delete the extra sidebar section at the bottom left if strictly following IMAGE 1's layout.
